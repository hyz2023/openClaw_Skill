## ⚠️ CORRECTIONS TO PREVIOUS REPORT

### What I Got Wrong:
1. **Listed ₱397M scandal as "recent 30 days"** — Actually occurred March 2025, only discussed in media Jan 2026
2. **Implied it was a new problem** — It was historical context being referenced, not a new Feb 2025 event

### What's Accurate:
1. BingoPlus does have ACTUAL recent problems (dead spins, withdrawals, support)
2. CasinoPlus genuinely has terrible recent reviews
3. PlayTime is indeed the best performer recently
